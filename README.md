# Motor-Control-in-Simulink
SimScape Model to control a Servo, Stepper and a DC Geared motor using the Arduino Hardware package for Matlab.
Part of a Lab Demonstration for my course. Model includes 3 subsystems, one for each motor. Each motor can be controlled with a sensor input or manual input using a GUI created within the Model. The top level file gives information about the pin connections. Attached are the a few images of the connections to the hardware.
